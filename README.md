Hello, I hope you're doing well.

This is a simple translator app I've made using the MyMemory translated API here's

the documentary: https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php.

I've made a local JSON file to list the different languages used in the app you can find it in "./assest/isos.json" 


You can see that it has the isos and the language and the voice, the used voices are from the responsive voice

here's the documentary https://responsivevoice.org/api/

If you have any feedback you want to share consider sending it via the email kaoucheaneslive@gmail.com
